# iProov Authenticator

The iProov authenticator, which is configured as a federated authenticator in WSO2
Identity Server, will allow users to authorize an authentication request using their facial bio-metrics while providing
a secure and convenient passwordless multi-factor authentication flow.

You can use the iProov authenticator to authenticate users to sign in to your organizationâ€™s applications. This
connector supports WSO2 IS from version 7.0.0 onwards.

## Getting started
To get started with the authenticator, go to [Configuring the iProov Authenticator](docs/config.md).
Once you have completed your configurations, you can authenticate users using the iProov authenticator.
